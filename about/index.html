                                        <p>I am a Sophomore at Tufts University studying Computer Science and Physics. I intend to graduate in 2018 with a triple major in Computer Science,
                                        Physics, and Mathematics. My primary areas of interest are software engineering, quantum information processing, computer graphics, computer architecture, and graphic design.</p>
                                        <p>I was raised in a suburban town in the south shore of Massachusetts, small enough that my high school was a three-town regional school. During high school, I was an active member of many organizations, and helped start my school's FIRST Robotics team with friends. I graduated valedictorian of my class, and after graduation began my freshman year at Tufts University. Since then I have been studying mostly Computer Science and Physics, with significant forays into Math and Arabic.</p>
                                        <p>Computer Science has always been my first academic love, and I'm interested in everything in the field. I enjoy low-level graphics work, and work that is held to tight optimization constraints &emdash; software bound to real time limits is more interesting to write. However I also enjoy front-end and even full stack web development because of the intersection of art and optimization. Though I am passionate about physics and low-level computer science work, I have no intention of downplaying the importance of art and design in my life; I can appreciate any discipline which allows that sort of creative expression. I strive to someday feel comfortable calling myself a full stack developer, and to never stop calling myself a student.</p>
                                        <p>Outside of my academic and professional interests, I like to read fantasy, listen to all sorts of music, draw, and mess with hobbyist electronics. I'm also a (still-learning) speaker of Arabic and like to learn more when I have the time.</p>
