                            <p>Bitshift was a JavaScript web game written in the Phaser game engine for my game development class. It follows a beleaguered Tufts computer science student in his or her androgynous attempts to fix a buggy game development project. The game was created with a group of four other students. It can be played on its <a href="https://johnygall.github.io/Comp23Project1/">project page</a>!</p>

                            <p>This was a project made for one of my classes, Object Oriented Programming for Graphical User Interfaces (it's a mouthful). It culminated in a simulator of unmanned aircraft control, including writing my own GUI elements and procedurally generated maps to fly the planes in. All five stages of the assignment are on GitHub.</p>

                            <p>This website was created in 2013 for my high school robotics team, in addition to programming the robots. It was recently taken down as students with web development experience graduated, but it constituted a considerable code base: more than 20,000 lines of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP written, not including all of the code I did not write.</p>

                            <p>This was a personal project I did over a few days in the summer of 2015. A friend and I began listening to one album every day, to round out our music knowledge. He made images in Paint, but that seemed like enough work that I wrote a utility to do it &mdash; I also wanted an excuse to write some C++. So the program reads in a list of albums, artists, and dates, and outputs a correct calendar. Album covers are scraped from the web.</p>

                            <p>Given my interest in computers, most art and design work I do is digital. However, I do enjoy actual, physical drawing, especially elaborate and intricate abstract designs.</p>

                            <p>This was the design for our team's t-shirts for the 2014 competition year. The design was printed on red shirts, and created with Adobe Illustrator. The design is based on the CAD of the robot, and the circular shape in the center was the top view of our robot. The main constraint was the color limits of screen printing, but I think it turned out very well.</p>

                            <p>As a hobby, and to practice design, I like to create book covers. In this case, I was inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien's original cover designs for the series, and vectorized them, also adding personal touches. One interesting challenge in this, though not visible in the cover to the left, was typesetting the Elvish languages on the covers.</p>

As a first project pursuant to this, and given my annoyance with the lack of high quality fan-made (or official) maps online while reading the books, I created a comprehensive map of the Game of Thrones/A Song of Ice and Fire continent of Westeros. The map is huge, and contains every major or minor location I could find in the books or online.</p>
