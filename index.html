                            <p>As a final project for Special Topics in Algorithms, Graphs, and Data Structures in spring of 2017, a <a href="https://github.com/uwaces">friend</a> and I created a visualization toolkit and analysis tool for binary search trees. We implemented Red-Black, Splay, AVL, WAVL, and simple BSTs using an API we wrote for interfacing with a tree in a way that records every access, modification, addition, and deletion. This is based on research by John Iacono on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry_of_binary_search_trees">geometric interpretation of binary search trees</a>. The project, along with detailed documentation and more disucssion of the theory, can be found on <a href="https://github.com/forsooth/BST-Analysis">GitHub</a>.</p>

                            <p>For a fun week's project over the summer of 2017, and to teach my younger brother programming, we built what we call a Sand Dial &mdash; a clock built from a self-turning hourglass. The basic mechanism is an hourglass stuck to a servo, across from a camera. The camera and motor are both run by a Raspberry Pi. Using OpenCV, we made a tight routine of <code>[thresholding -> Canny edge detection -> edge dilation -> contour separation]</code> to find the location of the sand in the image. When no sand is detected in the top of the hourglass, a signal is sent to the servo to flip itself. A video of it in action can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/hL9x73XRZr0">here</a>. My code can be found on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/forsooth/sanddial">here</a> and, for posterity, my brother's can be found <a href="https://github.com/nicasnes/clockified">here</a>.</p>

                            <p>CardControl is a web application for access control in a University system. It was built as a semester project for a Web Engineering class in spring of 2017, with one other <a href="https://github.com/CaerusKaru">friend</a>. It is built on the Angular 2 frontend framework, with a backend of Django, PostgreSQL, NGINX, Varnish, Redis, and AWS. I worked largely on those backend components, while the other student created most of the frontend. I also wrote an API using Tastypie for automated access control. We implemented many server-side infrastructure niceties, like CI through webhooks, simplistic process monitoring, and automated installation of all dependencies. To show off our access control application, we built a second web application (A Piazza clone named Azzaip) on a similar stack which used the API for our system to control which users had access to which site resources. The applications are not running currently (Running multiple AWS instances is expensive for a student!) but I hope to run them off of this site's server eventually, time permitting. Regardless, the code for CardControl can be found <a href="https://github.com/CaerusKaru/cardcontrol">here</a> and for Azzaip <a href="https://github.com/CaerusKaru/azzaip">here</a>.</p>

                            <p>For one homework assignment for Tufts' Computational Complexity Theory class in the spring of 2017, we had to write a Turing machine by hand, which the grading staff would then run through an interpreter. I took it upon myself as an independent project after the assignment to write a greatly improved interpreter for the Turing machine's syntax, which is this project. It has three debug modes corresponding to three different UIs, supports step-through debugging, and an animation mode to see the tape change in real time. It is written in Python. More can be found on its GitHub page, which is <a href="https://github.com/forsooth/Turing-Machine">here</a>.</p>

Some of our results are in the diagram to the left, which shows off the difference between a serial and parallel radix sort on integers. The repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/forsooth/CUDA-Sorts">here</a> although, as a disclaimer, some parts of the intended functionality were never implemented, including parallel algorithms for several sorts (concurrency is harder than you'd think!).</p>

It follows a beleaguered Tufts computer science student in their attempt to fix a buggy game development project. The game was created with a group of four friends.

He made images in Paint, but that seemed like enough work that I wrote a utility to do it &mdash; I also wanted an excuse to write some C++. So the program reads in a list of albums, artists, and dates, and outputs a correct calendar. Album covers are scraped from the web.</p>

                            <p>As part of a graphic design class, I created a series of four postage stamps. I chose to create a series of classic physics thought experiments. This piece is of Bell's Inequality, a classic result in quantum mechanics, that no deterministic, definite, real, causal, local hidden variable theory can explain the results we see from the formulation of quantum mechanics. In Bell's words, "the statistical predictions of quantum mechanics are incompatible with separable predetermination." Nothing but quantum mechanics or a mathematically indistinguishable probabilistic system can explain all of the results we see.</p>

This shows off the thought experiment of Maxwell's Demon, which is a statement about entropy and information, that if you kept track of every particle in a system you could theoretically reverse the natural entropy within that system, but the massive amounts of information you would need to record would require that entropy indeed does always increase.</p>

                            <h3>Abstract Doodle</h3>
                            <p>Given my interest in computers, most art and design work I do is digital. However, I do enjoy actual, physical drawing, especially elaborate and intricate abstract designs.</p>

                            <p>Several years ago I made a series of three poems. This one came out the best, and I might as well include it here.</p>

                            <h3>Arabic Movie</h3>
                            <p>For a video project in my Arabic class, I did a fair amount of design work in the Arabic language, which posed an interesting challenge. Especially given that the audience was mainly comprised of non-native, intermediate-level speakers who needed large, easy to read letters.</p>

                            <p>This was the design for our team's t-shirts for the 2014 competition year. The design was printed on red shirts, and created with Adobe Illustrator. The design is based on the CAD of the robot, and the circular shape in the center was the top view of our robot. The main constraint was the color limits of screen printing, but I think it turned out very well.</p>

                            <p>This is an ultrathin screenprinted shirt design for the Bridgburners, a fictional group from the Malazan Book of the Fallen. I think it turned out surprisingly well.</p>
